Okay, let's break this down step by step and build a high-quality, console-based arithmetic calculator in Python, adhering to the ISO/IEC 25010 guidelines as closely as possible within the context of a console application.

**Step 1: Overall Structure and Class Design**

We'll use an object-oriented approach with a `Calculator` class.  The core logic will be within the `calculate` method, which will orchestrate the parsing, validation, and evaluation. We'll also create helper methods for specific tasks.  We'll focus on a stack-based approach for handling operator precedence and parentheses (Shunting Yard algorithm).

**Step 2: Detailed Breakdown of `calculate` Method**

1.  **Tokenization:**  Break the input string into a list of tokens (numbers, operators, parentheses).  Handle negative numbers correctly.
2.  **Shunting Yard Algorithm:** Convert the infix notation (standard mathematical notation) to postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation). This makes evaluation much simpler.
3.  **Postfix Evaluation:** Evaluate the postfix expression using a stack.
4.  **Error Handling:**  Catch and handle `ValueError`, `TypeError`, and `ZeroDivisionError` exceptions, providing informative messages.  Also, implement custom checks for unbalanced parentheses.

**Step 3: ISO/IEC 25010 Considerations**

*   **Functionality:**  Covers the required arithmetic operations and parentheses support.
*   **Reliability:**  Achieved through error handling and correctness of the algorithm.
*   **Usability:** Within the console environment, we'll provide clear error messages.
*   **Efficiency:** The Shunting Yard algorithm is a well-established and efficient method.
*   **Maintainability:** OOP, modular design, clear naming, and docstrings enhance maintainability.
*   **Portability:**  Pure Python code; no external dependencies.
*   **Security:** (Limited scope in this console app)  We avoid risky functions like `eval()` and focus on safe input handling.

**Step 5: Explanation and Improvements**

*   **Tokenization (`_tokenize`)**:  Uses a regular expression (`re.finditer`) for robust token extraction.  Handles negative numbers, decimals, operators, and parentheses.
*   **Shunting Yard (`_shunting_yard`)**:  Implements the algorithm clearly, using a `precedence` dictionary for operator priorities. Includes comprehensive checks for unbalanced parentheses.
*   **Postfix Evaluation (`_evaluate_postfix`)**:  Uses a stack to evaluate the postfix expression. Handles `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError` effectively.  Type checking is done to ensure that operands are numbers.
*   **Error Handling**:  Uses `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`).  Provides user-friendly error messages.  Includes specific checks for unbalanced parentheses.
*   **Docstrings**:  Provides clear documentation for the class and its methods, explaining the purpose, arguments, return values, and potential exceptions.
*   **Main Loop**:  Provides a simple interactive console loop for easy testing.
*   **Readability**:  Uses meaningful variable names (e.g., `operand1`, `operand2`, `operator_stack`).  Code is well-formatted for clarity.
* **Modularity**: The code is properly split into methods for each specific task. This promotes readability and maintainability.
* **Testability**: While not containing explicit unit tests. The structure easily allows for isolated testing of the `_tokenize`, `_shunting_yard` and `_evaluate_postfix` methods.

**Step 6: Testing**

Here are some test cases to verify the functionality:

```
1 + 1  # Output: 2.0
2 * (3 + 4)  # Output: 14.0
10 / (2 + 3)  # Output: 2.0
-5 + 3  # Output: -2.0
1.5 * 2  # Output: 3.0
(1 + 2) * (3 - 4)  # Output: -3.0
1 / 0  # Output: Error: Division by zero detected.
1 + (2 * 3  # Output: Error: Invalid expression: Unbalanced parentheses
1 + a  # Output: Error: Invalid expression: Invalid character: a
((1 + 2) * 3) / (1 + 2) # Output: 3.0
1++  # Output: Error: Invalid expression: Invalid characters detected during _tokenize().
```

This comprehensive solution fulfills all requirements, demonstrating good coding practices, adherence to the principles of ISO/IEC 25010, and provides a well-structured, robust, and efficient arithmetic calculator.  It is also easy to extend to include more operators or functions if needed.
