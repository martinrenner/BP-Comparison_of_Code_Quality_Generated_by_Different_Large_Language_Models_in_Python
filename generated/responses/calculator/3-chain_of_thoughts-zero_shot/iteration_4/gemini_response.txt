Okay, let's break this down step by step.  We'll build a robust, console-based arithmetic calculator in Python, adhering to all the specified requirements (ISO/IEC 25010 considerations, OOP, no `eval()`, detailed error handling, etc.).

**Step 1: The Core Algorithm (Shunting Yard and Reverse Polish Notation)**

We'll use a combination of the Shunting Yard algorithm (to convert infix notation to postfix/Reverse Polish Notation) and a stack-based evaluation of the postfix expression. This approach efficiently handles operator precedence and parentheses.

**Step 2: Class Structure and Interface**

We'll define a `Calculator` class with the `calculate(expression: str) -> float` method as the primary interface.

**Step 3: Error Handling**

We'll use Python's built-in exception types (`ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.) to handle various error conditions, providing informative messages.

**Step 4: Code Implementation**

Here's the complete Python code, incorporating all requirements:

```python
import re  # Importing the regular expression module

class Calculator:
    """

    according to the order of operations, supporting parentheses and
    basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

    focusing on functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency,
    maintainability, and portability.

Key improvements and explanations in this comprehensive version:

*   **Complete and Detailed Error Handling:**  The code now includes extensive error handling, catching `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, and `IndexError` in various parts of the calculation process.  Informative error messages are provided, and exceptions are re-raised to be handled by the caller (the interactive loop or the test cases). This makes debugging and user experience significantly better.
*   **Robust Tokenization:** The `_tokenize` method uses regular expressions to correctly handle various number formats (integers, decimals, negative numbers) and operators and parentheses. Added a validator to check for invalid characters.
*   **Negative Number Handling:** Implemented robust handling of negative numbers, a common source of errors in calculators. It can correctly parse negative numbers at the beginning of the expression, after operators, or within parentheses.
*   **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `test_cases` list now includes a wide variety of expressions, including:
    *   Basic arithmetic operations
    *   Parentheses and nested parentheses
    *   Order of operations
    *   Negative numbers in different positions
    *   Division by zero (expected exception)
    *   Unbalanced parentheses (expected exception)
    *   Invalid characters (expected exception)
    *   Invalid operator sequences

    The tests also verify that the correct *type* of exception is raised when expected, and that results for floating-point are checked with appropriate tolerance (`abs(result - expected) < 1e-6`).
*   **Interactive Console Loop:**  The code includes an interactive console loop where the user can enter expressions and see the results. The loop also handles potential errors gracefully, printing error messages instead of crashing.
*   **Clearer Variable Names and Comments:** Improved variable names (e.g., `operand1`, `operand2`) and added more comments to explain the logic, especially within the Shunting Yard and postfix evaluation parts.
*   **Docstrings:** Added comprehensive docstrings to the class and methods, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and possible exceptions. This adheres to good documentation practices.
*    **Internal Error Handling**: Added error checks in the `_infix_to_postfix` and `_evaluate_postfix` methods for internal errors that theoretically should not happen, improving the reliability and debugging the code.
*   **Modularity:** The code is well-structured into separate methods for tokenization, infix-to-postfix conversion, and postfix evaluation.  This improves readability, maintainability, and testability.
* **Efficiency**: The algorithm used (Shunting Yard + RPN) is standard and has O(n) time complexity.

This improved version addresses all the requirements and considerations outlined, providing a high-quality, robust, and user-friendly arithmetic calculator. It's also well-documented and easily testable. This is production-ready code.
