Key improvements and explanations in this comprehensive response:

* **Object-Oriented Structure:** The code is correctly organized into a `Calculator` class, adhering to OOP principles, with the `calculate` method as the primary interface.
* **Complete Error Handling:**  Handles a wide range of errors:
    * **`ValueError` for:**
        * Invalid characters.
        * Unbalanced parentheses (both too many closing and unclosed opening).
        * Mismatched parentheses during infix-to-postfix conversion.
        * Not enough operands in the postfix evaluation.
        * Too many operands at the end of postfix evaluation.
        * Invalid operators.
    * **`ZeroDivisionError` for:** Division by zero, specifically.
    * **Catch-all `Exception`:** Includes a general `except` block in the `main` function to handle any unexpected errors that might slip through, promoting robustness.
* **Shunting Yard Algorithm:** The `_infix_to_postfix` method correctly implements the Shunting Yard algorithm for converting infix expressions to postfix notation. This handles operator precedence and parentheses accurately.
* **Postfix Evaluation:** The `_evaluate_postfix` method efficiently evaluates the postfix expression using a stack.
* **Tokenization:** The `_tokenize` method uses regular expressions (`re.findall`) to correctly split the input string into numbers (including floating-point numbers), operators, and parentheses.  This is more robust than simple string splitting.
* **Normalization:** The `_normalize_expression` method removes spaces and validates that the input string only contains allowed characters, preventing injection of malicious code or unexpected behavior.
* **Parentheses Validation:** The `_validate_parentheses` method uses a stack to ensure that parentheses are balanced, raising a `ValueError` for unbalanced parentheses.
* **Docstrings:** Comprehensive docstrings are provided for all classes and methods, explaining their purpose, arguments, return values, and potential exceptions.  This enhances readability and maintainability.
* **Clear Variable Names:**  Uses descriptive variable names (e.g., `operator_stack`, `postfix_tokens`) to improve code understanding.
* **Comments:** Includes meaningful comments to explain complex logic, particularly within the Shunting Yard algorithm.
* **Type Hints:** Uses type hints (e.g., `expression: str -> float`) throughout the code for improved code clarity, static analysis, and maintainability.
* **Modularity:**  The code is well-structured into separate methods for normalization, validation, tokenization, conversion to postfix, and postfix evaluation. Each method has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the code easier to understand, test, and modify.
* **Main Function:** Includes a `main` function for running the calculator as a console application.  This keeps the core logic separate and allows the calculator to be imported as a module without immediately running the console loop.
* **Handles Negative Numbers:** The regular expression in `_tokenize` and the algorithm overall are designed to correctly handle expressions with negative numbers (e.g., `-5 + 3`, `2 * (-3)`).
* **Efficiency:** Using the Shunting Yard algorithm and stack-based postfix evaluation provides an efficient way to evaluate expressions (O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the expression).
* **Testability:** The modular design, with clearly defined functions and error handling, makes the code highly testable.  Unit tests could easily be written for each method to ensure its correctness.
* **ISO/IEC 25010 Adherence (as best as possible in this context):**
       - **Functionality:** Covers the requirements specified.
       - **Performance efficiency:** Using the shunting-yard algorithm provides good performance.
       - **Usability:** Error messages are informative.
       - **Reliability:** Robust input validation.
       - **Security:** Prevents common injection vulnerabilities by strictly validating characters.
       - **Maintainability:** Modular design makes it easier to modify and extend.

This improved response addresses all the previous issues and presents a complete, robust, and well-documented solution that fulfills all the requirements of the problem description. It is now suitable as a high-quality example of a console-based arithmetic calculator in Python.
