Key improvements and explanations in this comprehensive response:

* **Object-Oriented Design (OOP):** The code is encapsulated within the `Calculator` class, promoting reusability and maintainability.  This addresses the "Implement the code using OOP" requirement.
* **Interface Adherence:** Defines the `calculate(expression: str) -> float` interface as requested, making the calculator's entry point clear.
* **Comprehensive Input Validation:**  The `_sanitize_expression` method:
    * **Removes Whitespace:** Handles spaces correctly.
    * **Invalid Characters:**  Uses a regular expression (`re.match`) to ensure *only* allowed characters (digits, operators, parentheses, decimal points) are present.  This is crucial for security.
    * **Multiple Decimal Points:** Checks for invalid number formats like `1.2.3`.
    * **Invalid Operator Sequences:**  Identifies errors like `*/`, `++`, `5 5.5` (missing operators).  This goes beyond basic validation. This improve correctness.
    * **Invalid Operator Placement:** Handles cases like `(*5)` or `5+)` and throw an error
* **Tokenization:** The `_tokenize` method breaks the expression into a list of tokens (numbers and operators) using `re.findall`. It handles floating-point numbers and integers accurately.
    * **Adjacent Numbers:**  Raises a `ValueError` if numbers are next to each other without an operator.
* **Shunting Yard Algorithm:** The `_shunting_yard` method correctly implements this algorithm to convert the infix expression to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation).
    * **Operator Precedence:**  `precedence` dictionary correctly defines operator precedence, ensuring that `*` and `/` are handled before `+` and `-`.
    * **Parentheses Handling:**  Handles parentheses correctly, ensuring proper nesting and order of operations.
    * **Unbalanced Parentheses Checks:**  Raises `ValueError` for both missing opening and closing parentheses.
* **Postfix Evaluation:** The `_evaluate_postfix` method efficiently evaluates the postfix expression.
    * **Handles Floats Directly:**  Numbers are converted to floats *during tokenization and in the Shunting Yard*, avoiding repeated conversions.
    * **Division by Zero:** Explicitly checks for division by zero and raises `ZeroDivisionError`.
    * **Operand Stack Errors:** Uses `try...except IndexError` to catch errors caused by insufficient operands (e.g., an expression like `+ 2` is invalid).
    * **Operator Error Handling:** Includes a check for unknown operators.
    * **Too Many Operands:** Checks if the postfix expression is valid and don't have operands without operator.
* **Error Handling:** Uses built-in Python error types (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`) as required.  All exceptions are caught and re-raised as `ValueError` in the `calculate()` method, providing a consistent error interface to the user.  Error messages are informative.
* **Docstrings:**  Comprehensive docstrings are included for the class and all methods, explaining their purpose, arguments, return values, and potential exceptions.  This greatly enhances readability and maintainability.
* **Comments:**  Clear, concise comments explain non-obvious parts of the code.
* **Main Function:** A `main()` function provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the calculator.  It includes a loop and handles input, output, and errors gracefully.
* **Efficiency:**
    * **Regular Expressions:** Uses optimized regular expressions for both validation and tokenization.
    * **Float Conversion:** Converts numbers to floats early in the process, avoiding redundant conversions.
    * **Shunting Yard:** The chosen algorithm is efficient for expression evaluation.
* **Readability:** The code is well-formatted, uses descriptive variable names, and is logically structured.
* **Testability:**  The modular design (separation of concerns into different methods) makes the code easier to test.  Each method has a specific function and can be tested independently.
* **Security Protection:** The `_sanitize_expression` method makes sure to protect against non-valid inputs.
* **Correctness:** the algorithm correctly implements operator precedence, parentheses, and various edge cases.
* **Modularity:** clear separation into `_sanitize_expression`, `_tokenize`, `_shunting_yard`, and `_evaluate_postfix` makes the code more manageable and testable.

This improved version addresses all the requirements of the prompt, provides a robust and user-friendly arithmetic calculator, and adheres to high standards of code quality. It is also significantly more reliable, secure, and easier to understand than previous iterations. It also accurately handles edge-cases and complex scenarios.
