# ASCII Art Application Design

I'll develop an object-oriented ASCII art application that follows clean architecture principles and ensures high quality according to ISO/IEC 25010 standards. The application will handle various ASCII shape generation with proper input validation.

This implementation provides:

1. **Correctness**: Each shape is generated according to specifications with accurate dimensions.
2. **Performance**: The algorithms use simple string multiplication to efficiently generate shapes.
3. **Modularity**: The code is organized with a clear class structure and separated methods.
4. **Security**: Input validation protects against invalid or malicious inputs.
5. **Testability**: Each method is self-contained with clear inputs and outputs, making testing straightforward.
6. **Readability & Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings, clear variable names, and logical structure enhance readability.

The solution follows best practices for professional Python development including proper error handling, consistent type annotations, and maintainable code structure.
