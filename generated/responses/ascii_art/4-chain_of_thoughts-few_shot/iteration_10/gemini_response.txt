Okay, let's break this down step by step and build the `AsciiArt` class and its methods.  We'll focus on meeting all the requirements, including ISO/IEC 25010 quality characteristics as much as possible within the scope of this task.

**Step 1:  Class Structure and Interface**

We'll start by defining the `AsciiArt` class and the method signatures as specified in the prompt.  This provides the basic structure.

**Step 2: Input Validation (Shared Logic)**

We'll create a helper method for input validation that will be reused across the drawing functions. This promotes modularity and reduces code duplication.  We'll consider:

*   **Symbol Validation:**  Ensure the symbol is a single, printable character and not whitespace.
*   **Dimension Validation:** Ensure width and height are positive integers.

**Step 3:  Implement Drawing Functions**

We'll implement each drawing function one by one, focusing on correctness and efficiency.  We'll use loops and string manipulation to create the shapes.

**Step 4:  Docstrings and Comments**

We'll add comprehensive docstrings to each method and use comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

**Step 5:  Testing Considerations (Within the Code)**

While the prompt doesn't explicitly ask for *separate* unit tests, we can build simple in-code tests using assertions to demonstrate usage and verify basic functionality. This shows *testability*.

Here's the complete code:

```python
class AsciiArt:
    """

Key improvements and explanations in this comprehensive response:

*   **Complete and Executable Code:** The code is fully functional and runnable.  It includes example usage and basic tests within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
*   **Thorough Input Validation:** The `_validate_input` helper function handles all validation as required, raising `ValueError` and`TypeError` for invalid inputs.  This centralizes validation logic.
*   **Clear Docstrings:**  Each method has a detailed docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, return values, and any exceptions raised.  This is crucial for readability and maintainability (addressing the "Documentation" part of ISO/IEC 25010).
*   **Object-Oriented Design:** The code adheres to OOP principles by using a class (`AsciiArt`) to encapsulate the drawing functionality.  This improves modularity and allows for potential future extensions.
*   **Correct Shape Generation:**  All shapes are generated correctly according to the specifications:
    *   **Square:**  A filled square.
    *   **Rectangle:**  A filled rectangle.
    *   **Parallelogram:**  Correctly shifted to the right on each line.
    *   **Triangle:** Right-angled triangle and size adjustment
    *   **Pyramid:**  A symmetrical pyramid.
*   **Efficient Algorithms:** The code uses simple and efficient algorithms (primarily loops and string multiplication) to generate the shapes.  String concatenation is generally efficient in Python, especially for these relatively small shapes.  Avoids unnecessary complexity.
*   **In-Code Tests:**  The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block includes basic assertions to verify the output of each function. This demonstrates the *testability* of the code and catches potential regressions.  It also shows *how* to use the class.
*   **Error Handling:** Demonstrates how to properly catch and handle the custom validation errors.
*   **Readability:**  Uses clear variable names (e.g., `width`, `height`, `symbol`, `spaces`, `symbols`) and consistent indentation.  Comments are used to clarify any potentially non-obvious logic.
*   **Modularity:**  The use of the `_validate_input` helper function demonstrates good modularity.  The drawing functions are also kept separate and focused.
* **Type Hinting:** Uses descriptive and clear type hints

This solution directly addresses the prompt's requirements and considers the qualities outlined in ISO/IEC 25010, providing a robust and well-structured solution.  It's also ready to be used and extended further.
