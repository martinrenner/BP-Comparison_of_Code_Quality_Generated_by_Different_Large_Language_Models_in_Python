Okay, let's break this down step by step and build the ASCII art application according to the ISO/IEC 25010 standards and provided requirements.

**Step 1: Define the `AsciiArt` Class and Interface**

We'll start by creating the `AsciiArt` class and defining the interface methods as specified.  We'll include comprehensive docstrings and type hints.

**Step 2: Implement Input Validation**

Within each drawing function, we'll validate the input parameters (width, height, symbol) to ensure they meet the criteria:

*   **Symbol:** Must be a single, printable character, and not whitespace.
*   **Width/Height:** Must be non-negative integers.

We'll use built-in Python exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`) for appropriate error handling.

**Step 3: Implement Drawing Logic**

We'll implement the drawing logic for each shape using efficient algorithms.  We'll build the multi-line string representation iteratively.

**Step 4:  Ensure Code Quality**

Throughout the process, we'll pay close attention to:

*   **Readability:**  Clear variable names, comments where necessary.
*   **Modularity:** Each function has a single, well-defined purpose.
*   **Testability:** The code is structured to make unit testing straightforward.
*   **Performance:**  Avoid unnecessary computations.
*   **Security:** Input validation prevents unexpected behavior.

**Step 5: Formatting and Output**

Finally, we'll present the code in a Markdown code block for easy readability.

Here's the complete Python code:

```python

Key improvements and explanations in this code:

*   **Centralized Input Validation:**  The `_validate_input` method is used by all drawing functions.  This avoids code duplication and makes it easy to update validation rules in one place.  The underscore prefix (`_`) indicates that this is a "private" helper method, not intended to be called directly from outside the class.
*   **Clear Error Messages:**  `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions are raised with informative messages that guide the user on how to correct their input.
*   **Efficient String Building:** Uses list comprehensions and `'\n'.join()` for efficient string concatenation.  This is generally much faster than repeated string concatenation using `+=`.
*   **Triangle width and height validation:** Added validation for the `draw_triangle` function to check the width and height, if they are equal.
*   **Docstrings:**  Each function has a comprehensive docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, return value, and any exceptions it might raise.
* **Concise logic of right-angled triangle**: The logic of the `draw_triangle` was simplified, and enhanced with detailed docstrings.

This code fulfills all the requirements, adheres to good coding practices, and is designed for maintainability and extensibility. It also meets the high-level software quality characteristics described by the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, such as: Functionality, Performance, Compatibility, Usability, Reliability, Security, Maintainability, and Portability.
