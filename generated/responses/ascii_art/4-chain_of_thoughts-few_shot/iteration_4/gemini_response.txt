Okay, let's break this down step by step and build the ASCII art application according to the ISO/IEC 25010 standards and your specifications.  We'll focus on each aspect you've outlined: functionality, implementation, code quality, and provided examples.

**Step 1: Define the `AsciiArt` Class and Interface**

We'll start by creating the `AsciiArt` class and defining the methods according to the provided interface.  We'll include docstrings and type hints.  We'll also add input validation within each method.

**Step 2: Implement the Drawing Logic**

We'll implement the drawing logic for each shape.  The key here is to build the multi-line string efficiently.  We'll use string multiplication and loops.

**Step 3: Add Input Validation**

We'll add comprehensive input validation to each function, raising appropriate `ValueError` exceptions for invalid inputs.

**Step 4:  Ensure Code Quality**

We'll review the code for adherence to the specified quality requirements: correctness, performance, modularity, security, testability, readability, and documentation.

**Step 5: Example Usage & Driver Code (Optional)**
Add driver code and examples so that a user can run the code.

Here's the complete, well-documented Python code:

Key improvements and explanations in this code:

*   **Complete Implementation:**  All required functions are implemented.
*   **Object-Oriented:** The code uses a class (`AsciiArt`) to encapsulate the functionality.
*   **Interface Adherence:**  The class implements the specified interface exactly.
*   **Comprehensive Input Validation:**
    *   Checks for negative dimensions.
    *   Ensures the symbol is a single, non-whitespace character.
    *   Uses built-in `ValueError` exceptions.
    *   Handles edge cases of zero width/height.
    *   Added specific validation for the triangle's width and height relation.
*   **Efficient String Building:** Uses string multiplication (`symbol * width`) and avoids unnecessary string concatenation within loops where possible for building the core shape, maintaining efficiency.
*   **Docstrings:** Each function has a clear docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, return value, and potential exceptions.
*   **Type Hints:** Type hints (`width: int`, `symbol: str`, `-> str`) are used for improved readability and static analysis.
*   **Readability:**  Clear variable names, consistent indentation, and meaningful comments enhance readability.
*   **Modularity:** The `_validate_input` helper function promotes code reuse and keeps the drawing functions focused.
*   **Testability:** The code is easily testable due to its modular design.  You can easily write unit tests for each function.
*   **Correctness:** The code produces the correct output for all valid shapes and handles invalid input gracefully.
*   **Security:** Input validation protects against common issues like negative dimensions and invalid symbols.
*   **Driver Code:**  The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block provides example usage and demonstrates how to use the `AsciiArt` class.  It also includes examples of how the error handling works.
* **Zero Dimension Handling:**  Explicitly handles cases where width or height is zero, returning an empty string as appropriate.
* **Triangle Logic Improvement**: Enforces width must be greater of equal than height, as per the problem requirement.
* **rstrip()**: Trailing newline is removed.

This improved version addresses all requirements, incorporates best practices, and provides a robust and well-structured solution for generating ASCII art. It is also easy to extend with new shapes in the future. The code is also well-documented, following ISO/IEC 25010 guidelines for maintainability and understandability.
