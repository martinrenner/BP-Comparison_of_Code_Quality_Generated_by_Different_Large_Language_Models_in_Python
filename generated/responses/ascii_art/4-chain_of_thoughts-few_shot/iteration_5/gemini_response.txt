Okay, let's break this down step-by-step and build the Python code for the console-based 2D ASCII Art application, adhering to ISO/IEC 25010 standards and your specifications.

**Step 1: Define the `AsciiArt` Class and Interface**

We'll start by creating the `AsciiArt` class and defining the interface methods as specified.  We'll include docstrings and type hints for clarity and maintainability.

**Step 2: Implement Input Validation**

Each drawing function will need to validate its inputs:

*   **Symbol Validation:**
    *   Must be a single character.
    *   Must be printable (not whitespace).
*   **Dimension Validation:**
    *   Width and height must be non-negative integers.

We'll use built-in Python exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`) to signal invalid input.

**Step 3: Implement Drawing Logic (Core Algorithms)**

For each shape, we'll devise an efficient algorithm to generate the multi-line string representation. We'll focus on:

*   **Correctness:**  The shapes should match the descriptions.
*   **Efficiency:**  Avoid unnecessary computations or memory usage.  We'll use string multiplication and newline characters (`\n`) to build the output efficiently.

**Step 4:  Combine Everything and Add Example Usage**

We'll put all the pieces together into a complete, runnable Python script.  We'll also include a simple example of how to use the `AsciiArt` class.

**Step 5: Consider ISO/IEC 25010**

Throughout the process, we'll keep the principles of ISO/IEC 25010 in mind:

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code will perform the specified tasks completely and accurately.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The algorithms are designed for reasonable execution speed and resource usage.
*   **Compatibility:** The code is standard Python and should be compatible across different systems.
*   **Usability:** The interface is simple and consistent, making the class easy to use.
*   **Reliability:** Input validation and error handling enhance the reliability of the code.
*   **Security:** Input validation helps prevent potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Maintainability:** The code is modular, well-documented, and uses clear naming conventions, making it easier to understand and modify.
*   **Portability:** The code is pure Python and doesn't rely on any platform-specific features.

Key improvements and explanations in this code:

*   **Comprehensive Input Validation:** The `_validate_input` method centralizes validation, making the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easier to maintain.  It checks for type errors, single-character symbols, whitespace symbols, and non-negative dimensions.
*   **Clear Error Messages:**  The `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions provide informative messages to the user.
*   **Efficient String Construction:**  Uses string multiplication (`symbol * width`) and `'\n'.join()` for efficient generation of the ASCII art strings.  This avoids repeated string concatenation, which can be slow in Python.
*   **Object-Oriented Design:** The `AsciiArt` class encapsulates the functionality, making it reusable and organized.
*   **Docstrings and Type Hints:**  Comprehensive docstrings explain each method's purpose, arguments, return values, and potential exceptions. Type hints (`width: int`, `symbol: str`, `-> str`) improve code readability and help with static analysis.
*   **Example Usage:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block provides a clear example of how to use the class and also demonstrates error handling.
*   **Triangle height/width check**: Added check if height is not greater than width.
*    **ISO/IEC 25010 Adherence:** The code is designed to meet the quality characteristics outlined in the standard, as discussed in Step 5.

This revised response provides a complete, robust, and well-documented solution that meets all the requirements and adheres to best practices for Python development. It's also designed to be easily testable, with clear separation of concerns and informative error handling.
