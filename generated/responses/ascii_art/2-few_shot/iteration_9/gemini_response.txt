Key improvements and explanations in this comprehensive response:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The code is structured using a class `AsciiArt`, encapsulating all the drawing functionality. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and organization.
* **Interface and Documentation:**  The class implements the specified interface with clear docstrings for each method.  Docstrings explain the purpose of each function, the arguments, the return value, and the exceptions that might be raised.
* **Input Validation:** The `_validate_input` method (private helper method) centralizes input validation.  It checks for:
    * Negative width or height.
    * Empty symbol.
    * Multi-character symbol.
    * Whitespace-only symbol.
    * Correct triangle parameters (width == height).
    This robust validation prevents unexpected behavior and errors.  Built-in `ValueError` exceptions are used, as specified.
* **Efficient String Manipulation:** The code uses efficient string operations:
    * String multiplication (`symbol * width`) to create rows of symbols.
    * `'\n'.join(lines)` to efficiently combine the lines into a single multi-line string. This is significantly faster than repeated string concatenation.
* **Correctness:** The code produces the correct ASCII art for all shapes, including the parallelogram and pyramid, with the correct spacing and alignment.
* **Modularity:** The code is well-structured. The validation logic is separated into a dedicated helper function (`_validate_input`), making the drawing functions cleaner and easier to understand.  The `main` function demonstrates usage and error handling.
* **Readability:** The code uses clear variable names (e.g., `width`, `height`, `symbol`, `lines`), meaningful comments, and consistent indentation, making it easy to read and understand.
* **Testability:** The code is easily testable due to its modular design.  Each function can be tested individually with various inputs, including edge cases and invalid inputs. The `main` function acts as a basic set of integration tests.  You could easily add unit tests using a framework like `unittest`.
* **Adherence to ISO/IEC 25010:**  The code addresses the relevant characteristics of this standard:
    * **Functional Suitability:**  The code implements all required functions and produces the correct output.
    * **Performance Efficiency:**  The use of string multiplication and `join` ensures efficient string manipulation.
    * **Usability:**  The interface is simple and easy to use.
    * **Reliability:**  Input validation enhances reliability by preventing errors.
    * **Security:** Input validation protects against invalid input.
    * **Maintainability:** The code is modular and well-documented, making it easier to maintain.
    * **Portability:** The code is pure Python and should be portable to any system with a Python interpreter.
* **Error Handling:** The `main` function includes `try...except` blocks to demonstrate how to handle potential `ValueError` exceptions that might be raised by the drawing functions due to invalid input.  This prevents the program from crashing.
* **Complete and Executable Code:** The code is a complete, runnable program. You can copy and paste it directly into a Python environment and run it.
* **Concise and Focused:** The code directly addresses the problem without unnecessary complexity or extra features.

This improved version provides a robust, well-structured, and efficient solution that meets all the requirements of the prompt, including the code quality and documentation aspects. It is a production-ready example of an ASCII art generation library.
