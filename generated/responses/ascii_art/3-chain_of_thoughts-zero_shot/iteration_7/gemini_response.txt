Okay, let's break this down step-by-step and build the Python code for the ASCII art application, keeping ISO/IEC 25010 standards in mind.

**Step 1: Define the `AsciiArt` Class and Interface**

We'll start by creating the `AsciiArt` class and defining the methods according to the specified interface.  We'll include docstrings and type hints for clarity.

**Step 2: Implement Input Validation**

We'll add validation logic within each drawing function to handle:

*   **Multi-character symbols:**  Ensure the symbol is only one character.
*   **Whitespace symbols:** Prevent using spaces or other whitespace as the drawing symbol.
*   **Negative width/height:**  Ensure dimensions are positive integers.
*   **Zero width/height:** Ensure the dimensions are non-zero

We'll use built-in Python exceptions like `ValueError` and `TypeError` for appropriate error handling.

**Step 3: Implement Drawing Logic**

We implement the drawing logic for each shape. It's important to aim for both correctness (accurate shapes) and efficiency (avoiding unnecessary operations).

**Step 4:  Ensure Code Quality (ISO/IEC 25010 aspects)**

*   **Correctness:**  We will verify outputs manually (and later, you would ideally add unit tests).
*   **Performance:** We focus on using efficient string manipulation and avoid excessive looping where possible.
*   **Modularity:** The class structure provides inherent modularity. Each drawing function is a separate, logical unit.
*   **Security:** Input validation protects against invalid inputs, preventing unexpected behavior or crashes.
*   **Testability:** The function-based design makes unit testing straightforward.
*   **Readability & Documentation:**  Docstrings, type hints, comments,, and meaningful variable names are carefully added.

**Step 5: Example Usage (Main Block)**

Demonstrate usage of the functions.

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    art = AsciiArt()

    try:
        print("Square:")
        print(art.draw_square(5, "#"))

        print("\nRectangle:")

        print(art.draw_pyramid(5, "X"))

        # Example of invalid input
        # print(art.draw_square(-5, "#"))   # Raises ValueError
        # print(art.draw_rectangle(4, 2, "  "))  # Raises ValueError
        print("\nTriangle (invalid):")
        print(art.draw_triangle(4, 5, "+"))  # Raises ValueError

    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Key improvements and explanations in this final version:

*   **Comprehensive Input Validation:**  The `_validate_input` helper function makes the validation logic reusable and keeps the drawing functions cleaner.  It checks for all specified error conditions (type, negativity, zero, symbol length, whitespace).
*   **Triangle with width and height:** The `draw_triangle` functions accepts now both `width` and `height`. It raises an error, if they are unequal to ensure the expected output.
*   **Clear Error Handling:**  Uses `ValueError` and `TypeError` appropriately, with informative error messages.
*   **Docstrings and Type Hints:**  Thorough documentation makes the code easy to understand.
*   **Example Usage:**  The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block demonstrates how to use the class and its methods.  It also includes examples of *invalid* input to show the error handling in action.
*   **Efficiency:** The drawing logic uses efficient string multiplication and concatenation.  For example, in `draw_pyramid`, the spaces and symbols are calculated directly, rather than using nested loops.
* **Modularity:** Each function does its specific work and relies on private helper method for validations.

This code fulfills all requirements of task description and follows the principles of ISO/IEC 25010 as closely as possible within the scope of a console application. This code is now highly readable, maintainable, robust, and ready for further extension (like adding more shapes) or integration into a larger application.
