Okay, let's break this down step by step. We'll address each requirement meticulously to ensure the final Python code is high-quality, robust, and adheres to the principles outlined.

**Step 1: Define the `Task` Class (Data Structure)**

We'll start by defining a simple `Task` class to represent individual tasks. This promotes better organization than using dictionaries directly within the `TaskManager`.

**Step 2: Define the `TaskManager` Class**

This class will handle all the todo list operations and manage the task data.

**Step 3: Implement Interface Methods (with detailed explanations)**

Each method will be implemented with comprehensive docstrings, input validation, error handling, and efficient algorithms.

**Step 4:  Consider ISO/IEC 25010**

We will explicitly address aspects of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard throughout the implementation.

**Step 5: Complete Code with Example Usage**

Key improvements and explanations related to ISO/IEC 25010 and requirements:

*   **Modularity:** The code is clearly separated into `Task` and `TaskManager` classes.  This makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain. Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.
*   **Correctness:** The code includes extensive input validation and error handling using built-in Python exceptions (`TypeError`, `ValueError`).  This prevents common errors and ensures the code behaves predictably.  The example usage demonstrates different scenarios, including successful operations and expected errors.
*   **Performance:** Using a dictionary (`self.tasks`) for storing tasks allows for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions based on `task_id` (O(1) on average for these operations).  The `search` function iterates through the tasks, which is O(n) in the worst case (where 'n' is the number of tasks), but it's a linear search that's generally acceptable for moderately sized todo lists.
*   **Security:** The input validation protects against invalid input types and values (e.g., non-integer IDs, empty task names).  This helps prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to bad data.
*   **Testability:** The code is designed to be easily testable. Each method has a clear purpose and defined inputs/outputs. You could easily write unit tests for each method using a framework like `unittest`.
*   **Readability & Documentation:**  Docstrings are provided for all classes and methods, explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions. Clear variable names (e.g., `task_name`, `task_description`) are used, and comments explain non-obvious logic.
*   **Efficiency:** As mentioned above, the dictionary storage provides efficiency for key operations. The search function is reasonably efficient for the expected scale of a personal todo list.
*   **Error Handling:** The code gracefully handles errors using `try...except` blocks and returns appropriate boolean values (e.g., `True` for success, `False` for failure) where applicable. This allows calling code to handle errors gracefully.
*   **Data Storage:** Tasks are stored in an in-memory dictionary, as required.
*   **Interface:** The code implements all required interface functions (add, remove, search, finish, get_all, clear_all) with the specified signatures and return types.

**ISO/IEC 25010 Considerations (Partial List):**

*   **Functional Suitability:** The code provides the complete functionality required for a basic todo list app.
*   **Performance Efficiency:** The code uses appropriate data structures for efficient operations, as discussed above.
*   **Reliability:**  Error handling and input validation are crucial for reliability.  The code includes checks for invalid input and handles potential errors gracefully.
*   **Usability:**  While this is a console-based app, the clear interface and error messages contribute to its usability.
*   **Maintainability:** The modular design, clear naming, and documentation all significantly improve maintainability.

This comprehensive solution addresses all the provided requirements in a clear, robust, and maintainable way. It adheres to the principles of good software design and considers important aspects of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard. The extensive comments, error handling, and example usage make it easy to understand and use.
