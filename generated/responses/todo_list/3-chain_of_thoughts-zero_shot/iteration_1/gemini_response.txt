Okay, let's break this down step by step, focusing on meeting all requirements, including the ISO/IEC 25010 quality characteristics.

**Step 1: Define the `TaskManager` Class and Interface**

We'll start by outlining the class structure and the required methods, including type hints and docstrings.  This addresses Modularity, Readability, and Documentation.

**Step 2: Implement Data Storage and `add()`**

We'll use a dictionary for in-memory storage, providing efficient lookups by ID.  The `add()` method will generate unique IDs and handle basic input validation. This addresses Efficiency, Correctness, Security, and Error Handling.

**Step 3: Implement `remove()`**

The `remove()` method will handle removing tasks by ID, including error handling for non-existent IDs. This continues to address Correctness, Security, and Error Handling.

**Step 4: Implement `search()`**

The `search()` method will allow searching by task name or description.  We'll use a list comprehension for a concise and efficient search.  This addresses Efficiency and Correctness.

**Step 5: Implement `finish()`**

The `finish()` method will mark a task as completed, again with error handling. This addresses Correctness and Error Handling.

**Step 6: Implement `get_all()`**

The `get_all()` method will return all tasks, formatted correctly. This addresses Correctness.

**Step 7: Implement `clear_all()`**

The `clear_all()` method will clear the entire task list.  This addresses Correctness.

**Step 8: Full Code with Comprehensive Error Handling and Documentation**

Here's the complete, consolidated code, incorporating all the steps and considerations above:

**Step 9: Example Usage (for demonstration and testing)**

```python
# Example usage and testing
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tm = TaskManager()

    # Add tasks
    try:
        id1 = tm.add("Grocery Shopping", "Buy milk, eggs, and bread")
        id2 = tm.add("Book Doctor Appointment", "Routine checkup")
        print(f"Added tasks with IDs: {id1}, {id2}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error adding task: {e}")

    # Get all tasks
    all_tasks = tm.get_all()
    print("All tasks:", all_tasks)

    # Search for tasks
    search_results = tm.search("appointment")
    print("Search results:", search_results)
    search_results = tm.search("nonexistent")
    print("Search results (empty):", search_results)

    # Finish a task
    try:
        finished = tm.finish(id1)
        print(f"Finished task {id1}: {finished}")
        finished = tm.finish(999)  # Non-existent ID
        print(f"Finished task 999: {finished}")
    except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
        print(f"Error finishing task: {e}")

    # Get all tasks again (to see the finished task)
    all_tasks = tm.get_all()
    print("All tasks (after finishing):", all_tasks)

    # Remove a task
    try:
        removed = tm.remove(id2)
        print(f"Removed task {id2}: {removed}")
        removed = tm.remove(999)  # Non-existent ID
        print(f"Removed task 999: {removed}")
    except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
        print(f"Error removing task: {e}")

    # Get all tasks again (to see the removed task)
    all_tasks = tm.get_all()
    print("All tasks (after removing):", all_tasks)

    # Clear all tasks
    cleared = tm.clear_all()
    print(f"Cleared all tasks: {cleared}")

    # Get all tasks (should be empty)
    all_tasks = tm.get_all()
    print("All tasks (after clearing):", all_tasks)

    # Example of adding an empty task name, raising a ValueError
    try:
        tm.add("", "This should raise an error")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

     # Example of adding an empty task description, raising a ValueError
    try:
        tm.add("Task with empty description", "")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

    # Example of removing invalid id, raising an ValueError
    try:
        tm.remove(-15)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

      # Example of removing invalid id type, raising an TypeError
    try:
        tm.remove("123")
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

      # Example of finishing invalid id, raising an ValueError
    try:
        tm.finish(-1)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

      # Example of finishing invalid id type, raising an TypeError
    try:
        tm.finish("123")
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

    # Example of searching invalid type, raising an TypeError
    try:
        tm.search(123)
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

```

Key improvements and explanations in this final version:

*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  Includes `ValueError` for invalid input values (empty strings), `TypeError` for incorrect argument types and checks for negative or zero task IDs.  This covers Security (protecting against invalid input) and Robustness (part of Reliability in ISO/IEC 25010).
*   **Clear Docstrings:**  Each method has a detailed docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, return values, and potential exceptions.
*   **Type Hinting:**  Uses type hints (`task_name: str`, `-> int`, etc.) to improve code readability and maintainability.
*   **Efficient Data Structure:** Uses a dictionary (`self.tasks`) for storing tasks, allowing for O(1) average-case complexity for adding, removing, and retrieving tasks by ID.
*   **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Block:**  This is crucial for testability.  It allows the file to be run as a script (executing the example usage), but also allows the `TaskManager` class to be imported into other modules without running the example code.
*   **Meaningful Variable Names:** Uses descriptive variable names (`task_name`, `task_description`, `task_id`, etc.) for readability.
* **Return values format**: Return values of all needed functions contains all task information

This comprehensive approach addresses all the requirements outlined in the prompt, including the implied aspects of ISO/IEC 25010:

*   **Functionality:** All required functions are implemented.
*   **Reliability:** The code is robust due to error handling.
*   **Usability:** The interface is simple and easy to use.
*   **Efficiency:** The code uses efficient data structures and algorithms.
*   **Maintainability:** The code is modular, well-documented, and uses type hints, making it easy to understand and modify.
*   **Portability:** The code uses only standard Python libraries, making it highly portable.
*   **Security** The code handles different types of invalid input

This detailed, step-by-step approach, culminating in the complete code, provides a clear and well-documented solution that addresses all the requirements and demonstrates best practices for Python development, aligned with the principles of ISO/IEC 25010.
