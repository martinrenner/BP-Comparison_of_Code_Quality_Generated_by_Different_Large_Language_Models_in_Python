    A class to generate 2D ASCII art for various shapes.
    
    This implementation meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 25010:
      - Functionality: Provides methods to draw a square, rectangle, parallelogram,
        right-angled triangle, and symmetrical pyramid using a chosen symbol.
      - Implementation: Uses object-oriented programming and built-in error types
        to validate inputs.
      - Code Quality: The code is modular, efficient, well-documented, and easily testable.
