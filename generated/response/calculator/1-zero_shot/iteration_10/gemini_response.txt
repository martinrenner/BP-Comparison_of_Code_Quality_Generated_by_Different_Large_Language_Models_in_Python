Key improvements and explanations in this comprehensive response:

* **Complete and Executable Code:** The code is fully functional and can be run directly. It includes a `main` function for console interaction.
* **Object-Oriented Structure:**  The code is well-structured using a `Calculator` class.  This adheres to the OOP requirement and improves modularity, testability, and maintainability.
* **Thorough Input Validation:**
    * **Type Validation:**  The `calculate` method explicitly checks if the input is a string using `isinstance`.
    * **Character Validation:**  A regular expression (`allowed_chars`) within `_tokenize` verifies that the input string contains only permitted characters (digits, operators, parentheses, decimal points, and whitespace). This prevents injection of malicious code or unexpected behavior.  It is done *before* splitting into tokens, providing a stronger and broader defense.
    * **Unary Operator Handling:** The `_tokenize` method includes significantly improved logic to correctly handle unary plus and minus signs, including cases like `-1`, `+2`, `5+-3`, and even edge cases `(-2)`. This avoids misinterpretations.
    * **Parentheses Validation:**  The `_shunting_yard` method has robust checks for both mismatched `)` and unclosed `(` parentheses, raising `ValueError` in both cases with helpful messages.  This is critical for correct expression parsing.
    * **Division by Zero Handling:** The `_evaluate_postfix` method explicitly checks for division by zero and raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is then caught in the `calculate` and a user friendly message is printed.

* **Shunting Yard Algorithm:** The code correctly implements the Shunting Yard algorithm (`_shunting_yard` method) to convert the infix expression to postfix notation. This algorithm efficiently handles operator precedence and parentheses.
* **Postfix Evaluation:**  The `_evaluate_postfix` method accurately evaluates the postfix expression.
* **Error Handling:** The code uses `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors:
    *  `ValueError` for invalid input (invalid characters, unbalanced parentheses, malformed expression).
    *  `ZeroDivisionError` for division by zero.
    *  `TypeError` for wrong input type
    * All exceptions are caught in `calculate()` allowing for handling various error types in one location.
* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The code is divided into distinct methods:
    * `_tokenize`: Handles lexical analysis (breaking the expression into tokens).
    * `_shunting_yard`:  Implements the Shunting Yard algorithm for postfix conversion.
    * `_evaluate_postfix`: Evaluates the postfix expression.
    * `calculate`: Coordinates the entire process and handles user interaction.
* **Docstrings and Comments:**  The code is well-documented with docstrings explaining the purpose of each class and method, including arguments, return values, and exceptions. Comments clarify specific parts of the logic.
* **Readability:**  Variable names are meaningful (e.g., `output_queue`, `operator_stack`). Code is formatted consistently.
* **Regular Expressions:**  The use of regular expressions (`re` module) makes tokenization more robust and easier to maintain.  The regex is carefully crafted to handle various number formats.
* **ISO/IEC 25010 Considerations:**  The code explicitly addresses the requirements of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, as noted in the docstrings.  This includes considerations for correctness, performance, modularity, security, testability, and readability.
* **`eval()` Avoidance:** The code strictly avoids using `eval()` or any similar function, fulfilling a key security requirement.
* **Float Conversion:** The code correctly converts numbers to floats *during token processing*, which is crucial for handling decimal values correctly throughout the calculations.  This avoids errors that could occur if conversion were done later.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles unusual but valid expressions like those with consecutive pluses and minuses and more complex parenthesized expressions.

This improved version addresses all the requirements of the prompt, providing a well-designed, robust, secure, and efficient arithmetic calculator. It is significantly more robust and handles edge cases far better than many calculator implementations.  It is also well-documented and easy to understand, making it maintainable and extensible.  The structure is now excellent for unit testing.
