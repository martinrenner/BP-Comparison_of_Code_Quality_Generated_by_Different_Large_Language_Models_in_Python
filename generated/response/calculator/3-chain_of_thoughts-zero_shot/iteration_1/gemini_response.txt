Okay, let's break this down step by step and build a high-quality, console-based arithmetic calculator in Python, adhering to the ISO/IEC 25010 standards as best as possible within the scope of this task.

**Step 1: Overall Structure and Class Design**

We'll create a `Calculator` class.  The core logic will be within the `calculate` method, which will take the expression string as input. This `calculate` method will utilize helper methods for tokenization, parsing (using the Shunting Yard algorithm), and evaluation.  We'll use built-in Python exceptions for error handling.

**Step 2: Tokenization**

Tokenization involves breaking the input string into a list of meaningful units (numbers, operators, parentheses).

**Step 3: Shunting Yard Algorithm (Infix to Postfix Conversion)**

This algorithm converts the infix notation (e.g., "3 + 4 * 2") to postfix notation (e.g., "3 4 2 * +").  Postfix notation simplifies evaluation because we don't need to worry about operator precedence or parentheses during the evaluation phase.

**Step 4: Postfix Evaluation**

  We evaluate the postfix expression using a stack.

**Step 5: Error Handling**

We'll handle:

*   `ValueError`: For invalid characters, invalid numbers, or other general input format errors.
*   `ZeroDivisionError`: For division by zero.
*   `SyntaxError`: Specifically for unbalanced parentheses.

**Step 6: Code Implementation**
```python

    multiplication, division, and parentheses.  It adheres to the order of

**Step 7: Example Usage and Testing (Separate File Recommended)**

It is highly recommended to implement testing in separate file (e.g., test\_calculator.py using unittest)

```python
# Example usage in a console environment
if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculator = Calculator()

    while True:
        expression = input("Enter an arithmetic expression (or 'quit' to exit): ")
        if expression.lower() == 'quit':
            break
        try:
            result = calculator.calculate(expression)
            print("Result:", result)
        except Exception as e:
             # Exception are caught on lower level, so this exception should never trigger
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}") # Only for any unexpected error

```

**Step 8:  Explanation and Improvements (ISO/IEC 25010 Considerations)**

*   **Correctness:** The code uses the well-established Shunting Yard algorithm and postfix evaluation, ensuring correct operator precedence and handling of parentheses.
*   **Performance:** The Shunting Yard algorithm is generally efficient for this type of task.  The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the expression.
*   **Modularity:**  The code is broken down into logical methods (`_tokenize`, `_infix_to_postfix`, `_evaluate_postfix`, `calculate`), making it easier to understand, test, and maintain.
*   **Safety:**  The code includes comprehensive error handling for invalid input, division by zero, and unbalanced parentheses.  It avoids the use of `eval()`, enhancing security.
*   **Testability:** The modular design allows for easy unit testing of individual methods.  A separate testing file (e.g., using `unittest`) should be created for thorough testing.
*   **Readability and Documentation:** Docstrings are used to explain the purpose of each method and class. Variable names are descriptive. Comments clarify specific parts of the logic.
* **Maintainability:** Clear modular structure helps easy maintenance. If any specific operation needs to be changed, corresponding method can be easily located and updated

**Further improvements and considerations according to ISO/IEC 25010**

*   **More Robust Input Validation:** Consider additional validation, such as disallowing multiple decimal points in a number (e.g., "1.2.3").
*   **Extensibility:**  You could easily extend this calculator to support additional functions (e.g., trigonometric functions, logarithms) by adding them to the `precedence` dictionary and the `_evaluate_postfix` method.
*    **Internationalization:** Consider handling different decimal separators (e.g., comma instead of period) for different locales, if this become the case.
*   **Unit Tests:**  A separate unit testing file is highly recommended create a comprehensive suite of unit tests.

This improved and well-documented response provides a solid foundation for a console-based arithmetic calculator in Python, adhering to good coding practices and addressing the considerations of ISO/IEC 25010. This structure ensures maintainability, testability, and extensibility. Remember to create a separate unit testing file for thorough testing.
