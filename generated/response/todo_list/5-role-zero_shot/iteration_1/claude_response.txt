# Python To-Do List Application

I'll create a console-based to-do list application that follows object-oriented principles and meets all the specified requirements.

```python

    searching, completing, and retrieving tasks.

## Design Decisions and Notes

1. **Data Structure:** I used a dictionary for storing tasks, with task IDs as keys for O(1) lookups, insertions, and deletions.

2. **ID Management:** The task IDs are auto-incremented integers starting from 1, ensuring uniqueness even after tasks are deleted.

3. **Input Validation:** Implemented robust input validation for all methods, throwing appropriate exceptions with descriptive error messages.

4. **Immutability of Results:** The `get_all()` method returns a list of dictionaries to prevent external modification of internal state.

5. **Return Values:** All methods have clear return values that indicate success/failure or return requested data as specified.

6. **Error Handling:** Each method includes comprehensive error handling and input validation.

7. **Documentation:** All methods include detailed docstrings that explain parameters, return values, and possible exceptions.

8. **Efficiency:** Operations are optimized to be as efficient as possible, with search being the only O(n) operation.

This implementation adheres to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by focusing on functionality, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, security, maintainability, and portability.
