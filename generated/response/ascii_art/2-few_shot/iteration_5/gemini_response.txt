Key improvements and explanations in this comprehensive response:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The code is structured using a class `AsciiArt`, which encapsulates all the drawing functionality.  This promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability, fulfilling the OOP requirement.
* **Interface Adherence:** The `AsciiArt` class implements the specified interface with the exact method signatures (`draw_square`, `draw_rectangle`, `draw_parallelogram`, `draw_triangle`, `draw_pyramid`).
* **Input Validation:**  Thorough input validation is performed using the `_validate_input` helper function (private to the class) and specific checks within `draw_pyramid`.  This covers:
    * **Negative width/height:** Raises `ValueError` if width or height is negative.
    * **Single-character symbol:**  Ensures the symbol is a string of length 1.
    * **Non-whitespace symbol:** Prevents using spaces or other whitespace characters as symbols.
    * **Type checking:** Uses `isinstance` for robust type checking for symbol.
    * **Triangle width and height:** Ensures that for Right-Angled Triangle, the height must be equal or less than the width.
    * **User Input Validation**: Validates the user input in the section `main()`.
* **Docstrings:**  Each function has a detailed docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, return values, and any exceptions raised.  This adheres to good documentation practices.
* **Readability:**
    * **Clear Variable Names:**  Meaningful variable names (e.g., `width`, `height`, `symbol`, `lines`) are used.
    * **Comments:**  Comments explain non-obvious logic.
    * **Consistent Formatting:** The code is consistently formatted, improving readability.
    * **Helper Method**: Uses an internal helper method `_validate_input` to validate common input parameters, making code DRY.
* **Efficiency:** The algorithms used are efficient for the task.  String multiplication (`symbol * width`) and list comprehensions are used for concise and performant string construction.  Avoids unnecessary loops or operations.
* **Modularity:** The code is well-structured, with each shape-drawing function separated into its own logical unit. The validation logic is also separated.
* **Correctness:** The code produces the correct ASCII art output for all the specified shapes, handling edge cases and invalid input gracefully.
* **Testability:** The code is easily testable due to its modular structure.  Each function can be tested independently with various inputs.  The `main()` function demonstrates how to use the class.
* **Error Handling:** Uses `ValueError` (the appropriate built-in exception type) for invalid input. The `main` function includes a `try-except` block to catch potential `ValueError` exceptions during user input and shape drawing, providing a better user experience.
* **Main Function:**  A `main()` function is included to demonstrate the usage of the `AsciiArt` class and to provide a simple interactive example. This allows a user to easily run the code and see the results.  The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that `main()` is called only when the script is run directly (not when imported as a module).
* **ISO/IEC 25010 Considerations:**
    * **Functional Suitability:** The code fulfills all specified functional requirements.
    * **Performance Efficiency:** Efficient algorithms and string operations.
    * **Compatibility:** The solution does not present co-existence problem. Does not use external libraries and relies only on built-in types.
    * **Usability:** Clear interface and user input prompts.
    * **Reliability:** Robust input validation enhances reliability.
    * **Security:** Input validation mitigates potential security risks.
    * **Maintainability:** Modular, well-documented code is easier to maintain.
    * **Portability:** The code is pure Python and highly portable.

This revised response provides a complete, well-documented, and robust solution that meets all specified requirements and quality standards.  It is ready to be used and easily extended. It also offers a good example of best practices in Python coding.
