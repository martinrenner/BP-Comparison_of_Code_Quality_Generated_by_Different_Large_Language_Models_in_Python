Okay, let's break this down step-by-step and build the Python code for the ASCII art application, adhering to all specified requirements and the ISO/IEC 25010 quality attributes.

**Step 1: Define the `AsciiArt` Class and Interface**

We'll start by creating the `AsciiArt` class and defining the required methods (draw_square, draw_rectangle, etc.) according to the specified interface.  We'll include docstrings and type hints.

**Step 2: Implement Input Validation**

Each drawing function needs to validate its inputs. We'll check for:

*   `width` and `height` (where applicable): Must be integers greater than 0.
*   `symbol`: Must be a single, printable character (and not whitespace).

We'll use built-in Python exceptions like `TypeError` and `ValueError` for clear error handling.

**Step 3: Implement Drawing Logic**

We'll implement the core drawing logic for each shape.  We'll focus on efficiency and correctness, building the multi-line string output.

**Step 4:  Comprehensive Code with Comments and Docstrings**

Here's the complete, well-documented, and formatted Python code:

```python
class AsciiArt:
    """
    A class for generating ASCII art shapes.
    """

    def _validate_input(self, symbol: str, width: int = None, height: int = None):
        """

            height (int, optional): The height of the shape.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If width/height are not integers or if the symbol is not a string.
            ValueError: If width/height are not positive, or if the symbol is not a single character or contains whitespace.
        """

        if not isinstance(symbol, str):
            raise TypeError("Symbol must be a string.")
        if len(symbol) != 1:

            if height <= 0:
                raise ValueError("Height must be positive.")

    def draw_parallelogram(self, width: int, height: int, symbol: str) -> str:
        """

        The parallelogram is slanted to the right.

# --- Example Usage ---
if __name__ == '__main__':
    art = AsciiArt()

    try:
        square = art.draw_square(5, "#")
        print("Square:\n", square)

        rectangle = art.draw_rectangle(7, 3, "*")
        print("\nRectangle:\n", rectangle)

        parallelogram = art.draw_parallelogram(6, 4, "+")
        print("\nParallelogram:\n", parallelogram)

        triangle = art.draw_triangle(5, "X")
        print("\nTriangle:\n", triangle)
        
        pyramid = art.draw_pyramid(5, "O")
        print("\nPyramid:\n", pyramid)

        # Example of invalid input:
        # invalid_square = art.draw_square(-5, "#")  # Raises ValueError
        # invalid_symbol = art.draw_square(5, "##") # Raises ValueError
        # invalid_symbol2 = art.draw_square(5, " ") # Raises ValueError


    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Key improvements and explanations in this code:

*   **`_validate_input` Method:**  This private helper method consolidates all input validation logic, making the drawing functions cleaner and reducing code duplication.  This improves maintainability and readability.
*   **Clear Error Handling:**  Uses `TypeError` and `ValueError` appropriately, providing informative error messages.
*   **Docstrings:**  Each function has a comprehensive docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, return value, and any exceptions it might raise.
*   **Type Hints:** Type hints (`width: int`, `symbol: str`, `-> str`) are used consistently to improve code readability and allow for static analysis.
*   **Efficient String Construction:**  Uses list comprehensions and `'\n'.join()` for efficient string building, especially for large shapes. This avoids repeated string concatenation, which can be slow in Python.
*   **`if __name__ == '__main__':` Block:** This standard Python construct ensures that the example usage code only runs when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module).  This is crucial for testability and modularity.
*   **Concise Logic:** The drawing logic for each shape is implemented concisely and directly, making it easy to understand.
*   **Comments:**  Comments are used sparingly but effectively to explain any non-obvious parts of the code.
* **Example of using** Added example.

This solution addresses all the requirements:

*   **Functionality:** Implements all required drawing functions.
*   **Implementation:** Uses OOP, defines the `AsciiArt` class, and implements the specified interface.
*   **Validation:**  Includes thorough input validation using built-in error types.
*   **Code Quality:**  Adheres to the principles of correctness, performance, modularity, security, testability, readability, and documentation.

This well-structured code is easy to extend (e.g., adding more shapes) and maintain.  It's also ready for testing with a unit testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.
