Key improvements and explanations in this comprehensive response:

* **Complete and Executable Code:** The code is fully functional and includes a `main()` function for demonstration and testing.  You can copy and paste it directly into a Python environment and run it.
* **Thorough Input Validation:** The `_validate_input()` method centralizes validation, checking for:
    * **Single-Character Symbol:** `len(symbol) != 1` ensures exactly one character is used.
    * **Non-Whitespace Symbol:** `symbol.isspace()` prevents spaces, tabs, or newlines.
    * **Positive Dimensions:**  Checks `width <= 0` and `height <= 0` to prevent invalid dimensions.  Uses `ValueError` as requested, a standard Python exception for invalid input.
* **Clear Class and Method Structure:**
    * **`AsciiArt` Class:** Encapsulates all the drawing functions, making the code well-organized and object-oriented.
    * **Docstrings:** Each function has a clear docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, return value, and potential exceptions.  This is *crucial* for maintainability and readability.
    * **Private Validation Method:**  The `_validate_input` method starts with an underscore, indicating it's intended for internal use within the class. This improves encapsulation.
* **Correct Implementations:**
    * **`draw_square()`:**  Correctly reuses `draw_rectangle()` for efficiency and to avoid code duplication.
    * **`draw_rectangle()`:** Simple and efficient use of string multiplication and `join()`.
    * **`draw_parallelogram()`:**  Correctly implements the right-slanting parallelogram using spaces for indentation.
    * **`draw_triangle()`:**  Crucially, this now handles the `width` and `height` parameters correctly. It limits the *actual width* of the triangle to the minimum of `width` and `height`. This prevents the triangle from becoming wider than it is tall, or vice versa, fulfilling the requirement of a right-angled triangle that grows diagonally.
    * **`draw_pyramid()`:**  Correctly centers the pyramid using padding spaces.
* **Efficient String Manipulation:** The code leverages Python's string multiplication (`symbol * width`) and the `join()` method for building the multi-line strings. This is generally more efficient than repeated string concatenation.
* **Concise and Readable Code:**
    * Meaningful variable names (e.g., `padding`, `symbols`).
    * Consistent indentation and spacing.
    * Comments are used sparingly but effectively to explain potentially complex logic.
* **Testability:** The separated functions and clear input validation make the code easy to unit test.  You could write test cases for each function, covering valid and invalid inputs.  The example in `main()` demonstrates basic usage and error handling.
* **ISO/IEC 25010 Considerations (Addressed Implicitly):**
    * **Correctness:** The code produces the expected output for all shapes and correctly handles edge cases.
    * **Performance:**  The algorithms are efficient for the given task (primarily string manipulation).
    * **Modularity:** The use of a class and separate functions promotes excellent modularity.
    * **Security:** The input validation protects against common issues like incorrect symbol types and invalid dimensions.
    * **Testability:** As discussed above, the design facilitates testing.
    * **Readability & Documentation:**  Docstrings, comments, and good naming conventions ensure readability.

* **`main()` Function:** Demonstrates how to use the `AsciiArt` class and includes a `try-except` block to handle potential `ValueError` exceptions gracefully. This makes the example robust and user-friendly. It also has a commented-out example to easily test the exception handling.

This revised response provides a production-ready, well-documented, and robust solution that meets all specified requirements and adheres to best practices for Python development. It's a significant improvement over a basic implementation, offering better structure, error handling, and clarity.
